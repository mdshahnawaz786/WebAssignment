                        To say that Nikhil Chinapa has donned many an avatar during his career, is like saying it snows in
                        <br>
                        Alaska; a bit of an understatement. He morphs from DJ to VJ to MC to Music Promoter to Festival
                        <br>
                        Director —some of his best known avatars — with amazing fluidity.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        He studied Architecture and graduated with a Thesis in Hospital Design. A year later and for
                        <br>
                        reasons that scientists are still trying to understand, Nikhil joined MTV. He said, “I think it’ll
                        <br>
                        be fun.” For once, he was right

                        <br>
                        At MTV, Nikhil has hosted almost every show the channel has aired. From MTV Select – MTV’s

                        on Roadies as well as Rock On and now host of MTV Mashups.

                        Nikhil’s Mom still thinks he’s an idiot though and should get a real job.

                        <br>
                        As a popular VJ, Nikhil got to spend a lot of time around his first love, music. In 2001, a

                        conversation between friends resulted in the launch of Submerge — India’s first, and now largest

                        <br>
                        By now, Nikhil had begun to DJ professionally and plays, well… whatever he feels like. His sets 
                        <br>
                        moody, varied, often erratic but usually fun. Most of his sets feature frantic foot-stomping and the
                        <br>
                        repetitive monotonous beat and is best enjoyed at dangerous decibel levels.

                        Nikhil was also the co-founder of Sunburn. He is now the Festival Curator and partner of Vh1 Super
